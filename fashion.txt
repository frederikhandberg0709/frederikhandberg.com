Personally, I quite like Alibaba because there are so many suppliers to choose from â€“ but this can also be overwhelming. I buy samples from suppliers and if I like the quality and price, I order the fabric. The problem with Alibaba is that suppliers often have quite high MOQs (Minimum Order Quanities) and also delivery times is usually about a month as they are often based in China. The MOQ can be 1000 meters, which is of course not feasible for a hobbyist like myself. Luckily, it is possible to find suppliers that will work with smaller quantities of about 20-50 meters of fabric, which is fine for me as I have many projects I work on, but is still quite a lot of fabric if you are not serious about sewing."]}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex gap-2.5","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex size-6 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-gray-600","children":["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm font-bold text-white","children":4}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-1.5","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-bold","children":"Garment Construction"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm leading-relaxed text-stone-700","children":"A nice thing about drafting the patterns in CLO3D is that they can be printed to paper and then drawn on to real pattern paper and cut out into individual pieces."}]]}]]}]]}]]}]}],["$","section",null,{"children":["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-center text-5xl font-light","children":"DESIGNS"}]}]]}],["$","$L5",null,{"children":"$L6"}],null,["$","$L7",null,{"children":["$L8","$L9",["$","$La",null,{"promise":"$@b"}]]}]]}],{},null,false]},null,false]},null,false],["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$1","ptvMeaqOzWnrUdcS5ER_V",{"children":[["$","$Lc",null,{"children":"$Ld"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"next-size-adjust","content":""}]]}],null]}],false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$e","$undefined"],"s":false,"S":true}
