I'm working on a notes app for macOS, built using Swift, AppKit, and SwiftUI.

This is my first app written in Swift. I had never used the language before starting this project. Because of that, I also hadn’t used SwiftUI or AppKit. I really like the Swift language, and SwiftUI feels familiar since I've used other declarative frameworks before, such as Flutter. AppKit, however, is a different story - it's hardcore 😅
There are so few resources online, and it’s very clear that it’s old.

Building a complex notes app while learning to use an entirely new tech stack is definitely not easy, but I find it to be much more fun, enjoyable, and rewarding to build something real - an app that's actually meant to be used by people.

## The Mission

I want to build the best notes app for **thinking**.

### How will this be achieved?

A *thinking app* shouldn’t just mimic text editors. It should work in a similar way to how we think as humans.

There are two main modes in the app:
- Note documents
	- Structured
	- Textual
	- Detailed
- Visual canvases
	- Spatial
	- Visual
	- Nonlinear

These two modes are interoperable. For example, drop a note document into a canvas and it becomes a live object with a preview.

I see the visual canvas as the perfect place to brainstorm. It’s a space where you can get ideas out of your head and onto something tangible. Drop images, notes, links, and sketches, then move them around until patterns start to emerge.

## Note Documents

Having excellent editing capabilities is essential - it’s a notes app, after all.

Note documents are stored locally on the user’s device as JSON files. They use a custom-made structure designed to support all the essential formatting features.
