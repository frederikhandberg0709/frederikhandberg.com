I'm working on a notes app for macOS, built using Swift, AppKit, and SwiftUI.

This is my first app written in Swift. I had never used the language before starting this project. Because of that, I also hadn’t used SwiftUI or AppKit. I really like the Swift language, and SwiftUI feels familiar since I've used other declarative frameworks before, such as Flutter. AppKit, however, is a different story - it's hardcore 😅
There are so few resources online, and it’s very clear that it’s old.

Building a complex notes app while learning to use an entirely new tech stack is definitely not easy, but I find it to be much more fun, enjoyable, and rewarding to build something real - an app that's actually meant to be used by people.

## The Mission

I want to build the best notes app for **thinking**.

### How will this be achieved?

A *thinking app* shouldn’t just mimic text editors. It should work in a similar way to how we think as humans.

There are two main modes in the app:
- Note documents
	- Structured
	- Textual
	- Detailed
- Visual canvases
	- Spatial
	- Visual
	- Nonlinear

These two modes are interoperable. For example, drop a note document into a canvas and it becomes a live object with a preview.

I see the visual canvas as the perfect place to brainstorm. It’s a space where you can get ideas out of your head and onto something tangible. Drop images, notes, links, and sketches, then move them around until patterns start to emerge.

## Note Documents

Having excellent editing capabilities is essential - it’s a notes app, after all.

Note documents are stored locally on the user’s device as JSON files. They use a custom-made structure designed to support all the essential formatting features.

### Why not Markdown?

Markdown is a great open standard supported by many apps, but I find it severely lacking in basic formatting. I get it - it’s meant to be simple. But sometimes, simplicity can also be too limiting for certain use cases…

Building a good Markdown editing experience is quite difficult. Obsidian is the only app with a Markdown editor I would want to use. Their live preview functionality is excellent, showing and hiding Markdown syntax depending on whether the caret is positioned between the start and closing tags.

I'm not a fan of using two separate panels side by side - one for editor and the other for preview.

So, my reasoning for not implementing Markdown support in the first version comes down to the lack of formatting options and the difficulty of building an excellent Markdown editing experience that meets my own expectations.
