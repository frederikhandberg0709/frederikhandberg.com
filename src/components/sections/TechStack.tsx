              <p>
                During the first semester of my{" "}
                <b>Software Engineering degree</b> in the{" "}
                <b>Software Development with Java (SDJ1)</b> course, I learned
                the fundamentals of Java programming and object-oriented
                programming in general. More specifically, I learned
                object-oriented programming fundamentals including
                encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. I learned to
                design classes, implement relationships (association,
                aggregation, composition), handle exceptions, and build GUI
                applications in JavaFX.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the second semester of <b>SDJ2</b>, I learned to create
                client/server applications using Sockets and RMI (Remote Method
                Invocation). I also got experience with implementing design and
                architectural patterns such as State Pattern, Observer Pattern,
                and MVVM. In addition, I learned using interfaces for flexible
                code, and using a Java testing framework called JUnit.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the third semester, we got a new course called{" "}
                <b>Programming 1 (PRO1)</b>, which focused on learning to design
                and develop larger distributed systems and securing them with
                authorization. For this, we used the Spring Framework in Java,
                more specifically Spring Boot to build a backend REST servers.
                <br />
                <br />
                In our semester project of the third semester, a requirement was
                that our distributed system must have two independent servers.
                One of our servers in the distributed system was using a REST
                backend implemented in Spring Boot. The other server was a
                SignalR server implemented in ASP.NET to handle
                live-notifications. For the frontend, we decided to build a
                JavaFX GUI for administrators and a Blazor webapplication for
                customers.
                <br />
                <br />
                The project was about a real-estate company that wanted their
                own webapplication to show their properties and a dedicated
                desktop application to manage the properties (add, update, and
                delete properties).

                On third semester in <b>Programming 3 (PRO3)</b>, we learned
                about the Spring framework and the helpful features it comes
                with, while also exploring Spring Boot to build backend REST
                servers and implement authorization using Spring Security.
                <br />
                <br />
                In my semester project of third semester, we built a distributed
                system using a REST backend server implemented in Spring Boot.
                The server included all the necessary endpoints for our system,
                including endpoint security using Spring Security for the
                endpoints where only logged-in users were allowed to access.
                <br />
                <br />
                We implemented a user registration and login system, where users
                could register and login to the system. For each request, we
                chose to send a JWT token in the header, which was validated by
                the server. We did this to verify if the user was logged-in,
                before they could access the protected endpoints.

                React is not something we have learned in class as of writing
                this, but we are supposed to learn it later during our course
                called <b>WEB2</b> on 4th semester that I am currently doing.
                However, I really wanted to learn building complex React web
                application.
                <br />
                The React documentation recommends choosing a framework such as
                Next.js and Remix. I decided to go with Next.js.
                <br />
                <br />I have always been fascinated by social networks due to
                their complexity. I think the best way to learn something is
                just to jump into it and start building, so I decided to build a
                social network using Next.js.
                <br />
                <br />
                There&apos;s no doubt that building a social network as a first
                project without a solid understanding of React and Next.js was a
                challenge. I knew how to use the most common hooks like useState
                and useEffect and how components worked, as I had built a few
                small projects in React. I had to redo a lot of things as my
                knowledge grew.
                <br />
                <br />I started out with many rookie mistakes like using
                useEffect&apos;s every time I wanted to fetch data. Later, I
                learned about React Query. A library that makes fetching,
                caching, synchronizing and updating server state in a React
                applications much easier.
                <br />
                <br />
                User authentication was implemented using Next Auth (now known
                as Auth.js). This turned out to be a mistake, as Next Auth
                intentionally makes it difficult to implement sign-in using
                credentials like username and password. Instead, they want
                developers to use OAuth. I did make it work eventually, but in
                hindsight, I should have chosen a different authentication
                library.
                <br />
                <br />
                Notifications are an important part of social networks. Users
                want to be notified of certain events, like when someone they
                follow publish a new post. I implemented notifications using
                Socket.io. My decision for Socket.io, was mostly due to me
                needing the notifications to be served in real-time without the
                user needing to refresh the page. I already had experience with
                SignalR, which is quite similar, so Socket.io seemed like the
                obvious choice.
                <br />
                Instead of implementing Socket.io directly inside of Next.js, I
                decided to build a secondary server running express.js, which
                would then handle the Socket.io connections. Implementing
                Socket.io directly inside of Next.js would require me to setup a
                custom server, which means I would lose the benefits that makes
                NextJS great like the automatic optimization.
                <br />
                <br />
                One of the things I really enjoy about Next.js, is being able to
                run both the frontend and backend in the same project. You can
                work very fast this way. I have all my HTTP endpoints inside of
                the API folder of my Next.js project. No need for a separate
                REST server. This does come with its own set of problems, as
                having a separate frontend and backend means you can scale them
                independently, whereas on Next.js (if used as a fullstack
                framework), it&apos;s in the same project. Or, if also having a
                mobile application, it makes much more sense to have a fully
                independent backend server.

                During my second semester in the <b>Database Systems (DBS1)</b>{" "}
                course of my <b>Software Engineering degree</b>, we learned how
                to design and build databases using PostgreSQL.
                <br />
                <br />
                The course covered concepts such as relational database design,
                normalization, indexing, and writing optimized SQL queries.
                <br />
                <br />
                PostgreSQL has been my database language of choice for every
                project I have worked on, both in school and in my personal
                projects

            personalExperience: (
              <p>
                In my social network portfolio project, I used Prisma ORM to
                define all my database schemas. Prisma automatically generates
                TypeScript types for these schemas, allowing me to use them
                throughout my application, and this is what makes Prisma
                type-safe. This means I can&apos;t accidentally reference a
                non-existent field in a table, as TypeScript will catch the
                error.
                <br />
                <br />
                Prisma also provides a very useful query API, making it easy to
                fetch data from specific tables. It can also be used to insert
                data into a table, update data, or to delete data from a table.
